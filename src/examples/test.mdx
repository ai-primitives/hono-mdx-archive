# Hello from MDX!

This is a test page to verify MDX rendering functionality.

## Features

- Server-side rendering
- Suspense support
- Streaming capabilities
- Component integration

## Code Example

```jsx
import { MDXComponent } from 'hono-mdx'

app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.jsx(<MDXComponent source={mdxContent} />)
})
```

## Dynamic Content

The following content is loaded asynchronously:

{new Promise(resolve => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('This content was loaded after 1 second!')
  }, 1000)
})}
